- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Joaquim Lagman
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... Game Development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... C++ Programming

 I am currently a college student learning to code. A little more info about me: I have a 
 passion for music and arts, but I took this route in the IT department because of my interest 
 in game development (and well, it would be the more realistic approach). Programming has always fascinated me. 
 I think I have better knowledge of Web Programming compared to software development and such. I have some 
 experience working with Javascript in relation to web development. For now, I've created my GITHub account 
 for school purposes. This intention will change later on when I start working, and hopefully become a professional.
